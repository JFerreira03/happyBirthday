                constantly making me feel so good when I am with you. <br>
                Even if it's just looking at your beautiful face (❁´◡`❁) or wathching you slowly fall asleep. <br>
                I'm so lucky to have you in my life. <br>
                I hope you have a wonderful birthday and that you know how much you are loved and how much you mean to me.<br>
                You're wonderful and I hope that you feel the same way about me :)). <br>
                And be sure to feel as special as you deserve ... or I will keep trying my best to make you feel like that dummyyyy :3 
                come to me if you don't, or if you ever feel sad.
